EDA and Data Prediction on the Telecom Churn Dataset
"Churning" refers to the number of Customers or Employees that leave a Company in a given time period. Changes in a business's churn rate can provide valuable insight into an organization.

According to the analysis, I came to the following conclusions:
26.5% Customers have left the Company within last month.
The company has more no of Younger Generation than Senior Citizens with almost almost equal no of Male and Females.
Younger Generation Churn more than compared to the Senior Citizens. So the company must come up with more ideas in interest of the Young people.
The company provides phone services to many of the customers (i.e 6361 out of 7041).
The customers who is being provided Online Security Churn less. So the Company should increase the number of Customers with Online Security.
The customers with Technical Support tend to Churn less. So the Company should increase the number of Customers with Technical Support
The Customers with DSL as the Internet Service churn less as compared to the customers with Optical Fiber.
The Customers using Electronic Check as their Payment Method Churn more comparitively.
Customers with Yearly Contract tend to churn less as compared to customers with Monthly Contract

Logistic Regression and KNN works well on the above dataset. However KNN gives more accuracy compared to other Machine Learning Algorithms with an accuracy of 83%
